## Obelisk.js in Node.js

This example does the following:

  * Loads a file named `figure` that contains a 3d figure represented as layers: Each layer is separated by the `---` string and the cells of the layer may contain a letter that represents its color. If no letter is present nothing is drawn in that place.
  * Draws that figure inside a [node-canvas](https://github.com/learnboost/node-canvas).
  * If the script is run inside [iTerm2](iterm2.com) draws the image in the console. If not it's saved in a file named `figure.png`

Take a look by yourself, an image is worth a thousand words!
